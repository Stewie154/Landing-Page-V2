## About

For this project I was given a static web page by Udacity, I needed to make it more interactive by using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.  

This Project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The functionalities added include:

    Dynamically populating the navbar with list elements in javascript.

    Writing a JavaScript function to determine which section of the website is in view, and adding a css class to that section to make it stand out.

    Making the dynamically populated nav links clickable, so they direct you to the relative page on the website.

During this project I've improved my understanding of creating / manipulating elements with javascript. I've now got a better understanding of the DOM and how it can be used to dynamically change web pages. 

The part that I struggled with the most was the function that displays the active section. But after ultimately solving the problem, I now feel more confidant that I can solve more problems moving forward.
